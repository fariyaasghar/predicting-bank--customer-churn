# predicting-bank--customer-churn
#### Pig E. Bank was losing customers but lacked a systematic way to understand why. Their retention efforts were reactive and ineffective. My objective was to answer the forward-looking question: Can we predict which of our customers are most likely to leave, and what are the key warning signs? The goal was to build an interpretable machine learning model to power a proactive retention program.
